    "The aim of this benchmark is to compare the most popularly and widely used codes for training word2vec and not necessarily the most optimized one. The code for training on each framework have been picked (and trivially modified in some cases) from the examples given in their respective offical github repositories. The code has also been reviewed by leading developers in each framework. Below are a few gitter chat snapshots and links for the same:\n",
